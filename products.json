After all, you’ve worked too hard for that conversion for a browser warning to derail you. An EV Code Signing certificate features all the benefits of a regular code signing certificate but offers identity assurance. And identity assurance is what gets rid of those pesky browser warnings and builds file reputation in Microsoft SmartScreen. Your EV Code Signing certificate also features an added layer of security—your private key will be physically stored on an external hardware token. This eliminates any risk of unauthorized use of your code signing certificate. In 2017, code signing is a requirement. Take the extra steps to not only guarantee your software’s integrity—but also to verify your identity to your customers. After all, nothing boosts conversions like trust.<a class='mod_view_more sc_feature_link' target='_blank' href='//sslfeatures.com/comodo-ev-code-signing.html'> View Full Product Details</a>",
